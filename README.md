One day, I was bored. So I decided to learn about the Fourier transform.

Stuff that helped me:

-   [Coding Challenge #130.1: Drawing with Fourier Transform and Epicycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY4luNgGfms) by The Coding Train
-   [But what is a Fourier series? From heat flow to drawing with circles | DE4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=646s) by 3Blue1Brown. The animation in this video of the portrait of Fourier is what I was trying to recreate.
-   [Epicycles, complex Fourier series and Homer Simpson's orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS4H6PEcCCA&t=601s) by Mathologer
-   [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSw2xFhMRN0) by blackpenredpen which is where I worked out the integrals for the formula deriving fourier series coefficients and they actually made sense. God, integrals are beautiful. God, math is so much more beautiful when you work out the equations yourself.
